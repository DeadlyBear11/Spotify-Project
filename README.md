# Spotify-Project
Work in progress of my Data Science project with data obtainted through Spotify API.

The collect_data_api.ipynb file conatins code to get the metadata of the songs I played during the last year on my Spotify profile from Spotify API. This code was originally created here: https://github.com/vlad-ds/spoty-records. I decided to grab his code and put it in a notebook to have a better understanding of what the code was doing step by step.

The spotify-EDA.ipynb file is the notebook in which I do exploratory data analysis of thousands of songs played by me during the last year and their metadata. Work in progress.
